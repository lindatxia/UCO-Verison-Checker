Continuity of service during dispute: With respect to Section 6 of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees to waive the language that would otherwise permit Asana to terminate the Premium Subscription contract in the event of an alleged breach of the Agreement by the Agency. Instead, recourse against the United States for any alleged breach of the Agreement must be made under the terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act or as a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act, as applicable. During the resolution of the dispute the Contractor, Asana, shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Agency Contracting Officer.</p></td>

No endorsement: With reference to Section 4(d) of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees that the Agency’s name, seals, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and the fact that the Agency has a presence on the Asana site and uses its Services, shall not be used by Asana in such a manner as to state or imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that Asana’s products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by the Agency or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by the Agency or the Federal Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, Asana agrees not to display any Agency or Government names, seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on Asana’s homepage or elsewhere on the Asana Site unless permission to do so has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant federal government authority.
